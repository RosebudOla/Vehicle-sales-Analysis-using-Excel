# Insights and Observations
There are 7 product lines being sold by the company Viz; Classic cars,Motorcycles, Vintage cars, planes,ships,Trains and Trucks and Buses. From my observation, the following is noted:
The total sum of sales for 3 consecutive years 2003,2004 and 2005 is 10,032,328.85 with the highest sales being in 2004 at 4,724,162 followed by 2003 at 3,516,979 and lastly 2005 at 1,791,486. This indicates that there was an increase in sales from 2003 to 2004 and a decline in 2005, this could be because the sales record for the year 2005 stopped at the second quarter of the year. The last quarter of the years (September to November) 2003 and 2004 showed a rapid increase in sales with November recording the highest sales at 1,029,837 and 1,089,048 which declined terribly in December of the year. This pattern is seen in the two years.
The top 5 countries by sales are USA, Spain,France, Australia UK with USA being the highest with about 36% of the total sales (3.6 million dollars) and the bottom 5 countries by sales include Ireland.philippines,Belgium,Switzerland and Japan with Ireland contributing the lowest sales at about 57,756. The difference in sales across varying countries could be as a result of the different types of transportation systems which a country prefers and the way of life of the citizens and residents of the country.
About 92% of the orders have been shipped, 1.4% are in the process of shipping, 1.5% are resolved while 1.7% are on hold, 0.7% are disputed while 1.9% are canceled. It can be deduced that their method of shipping and delivery seems successful and fast.
There is a significant difference between the purchase of the medium sized deals and the other deals. The medium sized deals consists of about 6 million of the total sales (60%) with the small size following at 2.6 million and the large size deals at 1.3 million dollar sales.
The most sold product in quantity and sales are the classic cars at about 3.9 million with over 33 thousand (qty) sold while the least sold are the trains with revenue of around 200,000 dollars. The other products are accordingly; Motorcycles-1.16 million with about 11,000 in qty,  Trucks and buses- 1.12 million with about 10,777 in qty, planes-10,727 in qty and 975,004 in sales and ships-714,437 in sales and 8,127 in qty. This could be a pointer to the demography of the customers.

# Conclusion and Recommendation
There seems to be a seasonal trend in sales,increasing marketing effort and offering promotions in the last quarter of the year to increase sales at the end of the year. Seasonal trend analysis is recommended to further understand what drives the sales in the last quarter and the reason for the declines especially in the year 2005.
Consider targeting market campaigns tailored to local preferences for each country and continue to expand and prioritize operations in countries that are performing well (the top 5 countries). Understanding the transportation system and import systems  for each country will aid in understanding the reason for the sales in each country,further analysis will be required to understand this and also customer demographics and market preference.
Put strategies in place to reduce order status that are on hold or disputed and continue to maintain the high shipping status
Since medium deal sizes are selling highest,continue to focus on them and the large deal sizes that are recording low sales might be considered for incentivization.
